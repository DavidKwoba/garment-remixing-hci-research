1,"Another progress shot… the jacket construction is actually much faster than I’d imagined. Especially since I don’t need to worry about lining, hems and facings. It’s looking cosy, isn’t it?

🧥 

Improvising a lot as the original pattern calls for flat felled seams. I managed shoulder seams ok but all the other seams are bound. With matching voile internally. And I decided to cheat and go with a lovely soft pre-made bias binding from @fabric.journey for the collar, pockets, sleeve hems and other edges. I think the grey ombré check ties it all together.

🧵 🪡 

Lots of hand binding today and then I need to decide if I want buttons or press studs! Wish me luck 🤞

🏷 With many thanks to @dianavandeyar who shared her tips and tricks using the #paolajacket pattern to make a quilt coat. Go check out her feed for her incredible make 😘

🏷 Fabric: Hope Valley and Greenfield Hills (voile lining) by @dsquilts. Assorted low volume prints 

🏷 Quilt pattern: Jacob’s Ladder blocks made by the #muststashbee gals many moons ago. Look back in my feed to see how I quilted it on my Q16.

11,Today I’m joining the #quiltcoatfashionshow with my (almost) finished quilt coat from a well worn vintage quilt I bought in an online auction. I still plan to add some loop button closures and a few more triangle transplants to the back for stability - the quilt was a bit more well worn than advertised when I bought it! But I so love the crinkly texture and buttery softness and the faded colors. I wonder about the hands that made the quilt and how long ago it was .... Happy to have given the quilt new life in this lovely coat. Thanks to @maeberrysquare and @tina1802 for all the great tips and encouragement during #quiltcoatalong It has been great to see all the creativity during this QAL.

13,"this Paola jacket has been one of my favorite pieces I've made so far 🤎

it was a real son of a bitch to actually sew, with the flat felled seams along the sleeves literally drawing blood and making my fingers feel raw, but ooooo baby it was worth it! 

I added an internal pocket based on original vintage workwear jackets I saw online, and (messily) bound the facing on the inside with cotton twill tape, which was a mistake but I'll live with it. 

anyway I've worn this so many times already and I can't wait to see how it naturally weathers over time! also planning on making my mom one in red denim 💯

23,"So excited to share my newest sewing DIY thrift flip -> a coat made from quilted pillow shams found at the thrift store for $12!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
BACKGROUND: A bit ago I started to see quilted coats popping up in Instagram and YouTube. I love the idea of bringing a textile full of heritage, thoughtfulness and hand-crafting into everyday wear. Plus since I love floral prints and vintage style so much this project was right up my alley. A few weekends ago we stopped by Valley Thrift after hearing about it from fellow sewist @alissahthreads and I found a 4 pack of quilted pillow shams that I thought would be great for my coat experiment!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
SEWING DETAILS: I used the Paola Workwear Jacket from @fabricsstorecom and followed the pattern for the most part. I changed up the collar and decided to go without a facing & instead used a bias binding around the raw edges. I like how this turned out because the print added to the quilted vibe even more. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Right now the jacket has no closures and I haven’t decided if I will add them or not. A part of me wants to get snaps but another part of me is lazy and I rarely button up my coats anyway so what’s the point? 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
VERDICT: I love the uniqueness of this jacket and knowing it truly is one of a kind. I picked up another quilt at the thrift store, I plan to create another Paola Jacket, this time sticking a little more closely to the true Chore Coat look for the collar and front closure. 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
What do you think, would you wear a quilt coat?!

28,"muslin of the #paolaworkwearjacket in some old drop cloth i dyed blue once i discovered i liked how it had turned out. after my toils with the #julienreadytosew, i found this pattern suited me better - no drop sleeves to tangle with, the collar goes in nicely, and the facings are smart on a jacket you might often wear unbuttoned. ⁣vintage buttons from @swansonsfabrics. 
⁣
i sewed a medium based on my bust measurement and after comparing the finished garment measurements to my favorite chore coats. ⁣
⁣
i think i’m ready to try this with my beloved pom pom coating, with a few mods: add 2 inches to body and arm length, steal the angled lower pockets from the julian coat, deepen the facings a bit. maybe some side vents? maybe make the center back seam a feature rather than a bug borne of my thoughtless cutting? also i think i’ll make a large - this fits well but i like a cozy oversized fit for the poms. ⁣

29,"I finished the #paolajacket from @fabricsstorecom for Hudson! 

I have a suspicion that the fabric is an upholstery fabric because it feels durable (peep at our cat trying to hold on for dear life with her claws) but I can't be sure since we got it from the discount/end of bolt section at the fabric store nearby. It didn't melt when I ironed it on high though so that's good! 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

This is a size 8, and I took off about 2 inches from the bottom since Hudson likes a more 4 look. I love the brass button snaps as it gives it a cleaner finish. Very easy to install and might use it for my own #paolaworkwearjacket 🙈

This was a slower make for me, doing only one section at time everyday. I think this was better for me instead of pushing through a project (and getting so frustrated!!!!! when something doesn't go right!!!!) so I can finish it and wear it asap. Being able to sew your own clothes is really just about paitence and as a beginner, I'm still learning that. After all, if I just wanted to wear something asap, I have fast fashion for that.

Some victories: Learned how to do a flat felled seam, learned how to do a collar, installed button snaps!

45,"Quilted jackets are having a moment right now! I happened upon this pre-quilted and lined bargain bin fabric and felt like I struck gold! All the work is done, so I can just sew up a coat real quick once, right? (Had to let my Wisconsin phrasing out for that one.) Ha. Famous last words of every sewist!
•
I used the free @fabricsstorecom #paolaworkwearjacket pattern. The process of downloading their free patterns is a little bit odd, but so worth it! This one sewed up exactly as expected. I wanted a simple slightly oversized silhouette, and it delivered. My measurements are B:42” W:38” H:42” and I made a straight size 16/18. I left off the collar and facings as well as the top pockets.
•
Here’s where my famous last words come in. I originally lengthened this by about 6-8” based on a ready to wear coat I’d seen. I was so excited for this project and then it ended up looking very odd at that length. I think the contrast binding had something to do with it, but I was determined to make my life easier by using pre-made bias tape, so matching wasn’t an option. I was no longer excited about this jacket. I made a collar and added that thinking it might help. Nope. Now I was downright mad at this jacket. Anyone else build a project up in their head and then struggle with how you feel about it when it doesn’t work quite right for some reason?
• 
Ultimately, I decided shorter would be better and commenced with unpicking lots of bias binding. On the shorter version, I did like collarless better, so the collar got unpicked also. It was a little bit of a frustrating journey, and not nearly as quick and easy as I planned, but we got there in the end! I love this jacket and have already worn it so much! I caught some frosty early morning light for photos and my new quilted jacket kept me warm while I did it!

I could not follow all the instruction as the wool is 5mm thick so I opted for overlapping seams everywhere, no lining, no interfacing. 

Really enjoyed the process and will be reusing the pattern to make a lighter jacket as well!

Size 12/14 which is a bit too big in the shoulders, would cut a size 8/10 next time. 

Cut the neck hole with the smallest size to make it closer to the neck 

Reduced the length by 2 inches, the pockets have been slightly moved up as well

I used a lightweight wool blend suiting that I bought many years ago and old hand-me-down buttons, so including the free pattern this pretty much cost me the £2 for the thread. Very satisfying, and feels like wasting a cosy, utilitarian blanket with pockets. 
As far as changes, I made the size 8-10 and graded to to the next size up at the hips, added two extra buttons and changed the pocket shape. Other that that I pretty much followed the instructions to the letter including the lovely flat-felled seams throughout.

52,"My first #QuiltCoat! And I even managed a freezing cold photoshoot thanks to my beau.

I made the (free) #PaolaJacket in size 8/10 out of a hand-tied quilt I thrifted (which didn’t actually have batting inside, just a couple layers of cotton, d’oh!). I cut the pieces out, painstakingly chose a simple quilting pattern for my first quilting project, and quilted all the pieces with regular poly thread. It felt like it took forever and the quilt was far from perfectly even so my mostly-even lines look a bit haphazard. Oh well!

I modified the pattern to make it more quilt-friendly based on the experience of many sewists including helpful tips from @dianavandeyar and @zimmermade. My mods included:
⭐️No facings
⭐️Bias bound seams (which I made a terrible mess of in so many ways but only I will notice)
⭐️Lengthened the back by 4-5” and rounded off the side seams to mimic the #TamarackJacket
⭐️Omitted the top pockets
⭐️Omitted closures (for now; may add buttons or snaps)

I’m glad I included a collar, but the binding on it is a bit of a mess. Lots of quilt coats on IG are collarless… I’m guessing because it’s a tough spot with loads of seams. But @BuriedDiamond recently blogged in detail about her gorgeous quilt coat including stunning collar construction, so I’m excited to try again.

There are more quilt coats in my future for sure! This one is super cozy and I’ve been wearing it around the house in the weeks since finishing it. It was the perfect throw-on jacket for walks in the unseasonably warm weather at the start of this month, but it’ll likely be more of a housecoat ’til April.

🧥I made two toiles before this, first one in a large and it was way too big, then I made another toile in a medium with front+back and sleeves lengthened by about 5cm. Tightened the sleeves slightly since Mr K said they are a bit like kung fu style sleeves (too baggy). This final version is the same as the second toile.

🧥I squeezed, like really squeezed, this jacket out of 1.8 m of fabrics. I didn’t have enough for the pockets, had to omit the upper pockets and shorten the lower pockets to make it work🙌🏽

56,"Presenting my Scrap Jacket! Made entirely from stuff I had left over from other projects: cotton twill (@cloth_story), homemade linen bias tape (@blackbirdfabrics), buttons (eBay!), even the interfacing. 

The pattern is the #paolaworkwearjacket, which is FREE, so I spent 0 additional dollars to make this coat. The actual cost is probably around $200 (~$80 for supplies, the rest in labor).

This was a really pleasant pattern to make. Easy to follow instructions despite a couple steps that omitted key info. I cut a size 8/10 based on other people’s reviews that the sizing is generous. The sleeves are the perfect size to layer over sweaters. I modified it slightly:
• trimmed 3.5” off the length for a more 4 fit
• shortened and reshaped the pockets
• used bias tape on the facing instead of overlocking & stitching it to the jacket front. I didn’t want the visible stitching and I hate the feel of overlocked edges against my skin.

Every seam is flat felled or bound and it feels very sturdy. It’s already in regular rotation for morning walks; I can carry a lot of toddler snacks in these pockets.

I did have a weird issue with the fabric after assembled (pic 4): some creases lost their dye during a wash cycle. I’m going to embrace the look and wash it like crazy. Hopefully that will dull the color overall and add more evenly distributed crinkles for a natural worn in look. Fingers crossed.

Scils learned: flat felled seams, bias bound facing (inspired by @minimalistmachinist).
I managed to sew the flat felled seams in the sleeves, which is super challenging!
Changes: I 4 the length by 5 cm, removed the upper pockets, added a center back seam and a sleeve detail from the #maracoat. Swipe to see how pretty it is on the inside and all the other details.😊
I don't know exactly what fabric this is, I got it with a mistery bundle from @bohofabrics.

I’ve been trying to change my mindset with sewing, wanting to sew fewer things with better finishes and more attention to detail. I’ve noticed that when I buy fabric or a pattern without a plan, it adds stress by feeling like an obligation or something added to my to-do list, which doesn’t mesh with this hobby I’ve chosen that helps me unwind. So for now I’m trying to sew through what I have or only buy with a purpose :) easier said than done bc project planning and fabric shopping are kind of their own hobbies too.

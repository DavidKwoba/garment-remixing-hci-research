Kids screaming in the background? ✔
Babies interrupting my photo ✔✔
All for the fun of #mmmay 😬
This is a dress a hacked from a thrift find to try and look like a dress from Little Women.
The shirt I believe is a hinterland dress hack from a men's button up. 
The shirt is maybe 2"" too short to stay comfortably under the dress and keeps peeking out the sides, oh well 🤷‍♀️. I am also a little less chesty than I was when I made it and think maybe it sits a bit low now? Idk. 
I do however love the stripes and pink together and am reminded of how comfortable this dress is. 
People always mock grandmas for wearing muumuus but they know the secret of comfort and aren't all these flowy wide dresses just the young woman's muumuu?? Just food for thought. 
I should add the last photo is day 3 in my #pepperminloungeshirt 💙😬

I’m pretty sure the fabric is thrifted.

today I had fun re-discovering some pieces from my #memade wardrobe! I never realized how much I like them, until now! I guess that's the beauty of #memademay :)

details: today I'm wearing my #hinterlanddress hacked into a shirt, and I added a peplum using the #peppermintpeplumtop (because it was too short without it!🙈) for pants, I'm wearing my #visiblymended jeans that I got as hand me downs a couple of years ago! and surprise surprise, the handmade cardigan from my Auntie😊

I'm curious - what are your favorite go-to garments?",instagram.com/p/CObRR4CMQLc,,6,4,57,
4,"It’s #memademay2021 and I’m ready to start wearing those handmade items I haven’t been wearing.
I’m starting with this #hinterlanddresstop that I made years ago. I believe I haven’t worn it because it’s such a cropped top and I’ve never thought about how I could layer it.
So, I tried a few variations with this green secondhand dress I love to bits and a thrifted belt.
I love the first outfit the most, but it also looks lovely with the green dress on top and it’s okay without the belt too, but I’m definitely loving the belt!
What do you think?
Have you hacked the hinterland to just make a top?
Let me know how you style it.

🌿 Amy

6,I think I may have just made my favourite dress so far 💕This is my 2nd #hinterlanddress. I went down a dress size and used a smaller seam allowance. It first perfectly. I was resourceful with my 2 metres of fabric and added a short ruffle at the bottom of the dress. I also used scrap fabric for the bias binding neckline. I am so happy with it.

18,"A nod to my Dutch heritage 🇳🇱

I’ve had this fabric in my stash for many many many years. Blue is not my colour but the windmills got me. I went to Holland to meet my family and see the kasteel where my Oma skated as a girl and where she grew up and it felt so much like home. And everyone had my nose! I hope to get a chance to go back one day. 

Also got big compliments today on it’s first wear and got asked if I always where my own clothes (coz they’re so unique haha) and if I wanted to teach. Random. 

I decided to try the v-neck #hinterlanddresshack from the @sewliberated blog. I didn’t do the dancing though, instead just did the bias tape as per the original and hand stitched it down. Also didn’t make the placket angled but kept it square coz I wanted to, and I hand stitched that on wrong sides together (rather that sew right sides together then turn out) coz it ended up neater. I moved to the bust darts to the waist, and for some reason even having sewed them 3 times they still stayed pointy 🤷🏻‍♀️ kept the patterns original waist ties but tied them at the front. Super comfy, great buttons and cute kiddies approved ☺️

Pattern: hacked #hinterlanddress bodice by @sewliberated. Hacked #seamworkcatarina skirt by @seamwork to get a bit more fullness than the hinterland skirt. And my favourite pockets from the #springejumpsuit by @sewlovepatterns. 

Fabric: cotton from @spotlightstores from like maybe 7 years ago 🤭? 

Buttons: sand blasted buttons from @minervasbower - they have the most amazing range of buttons!!!!!

I just finished my first @sewliberated Hinterland dress yesterday, and love the finish, but, I wanted to alter a few things before I cut into my gorgeous plaid flannel for the second go-around:
-change the neckline to a v-neck
-expand the sleeves for a looser fit ( guess I got big biceps 😆) 
And
-grade between two sizes for a better shoulder and back finish!

I think its going well... I’m sewing my muslin in vintage cotton sheeting, something I always have around from the thrift store and perfect for testing patterns with!

Last night I dreamt we were truck drivers.

We met at one of those larger-than-life truck stops while rummaging through a box of discounted books crammed between a display of tourist trinkets and a shelf of potato chips. 

We kept correspondence via CB Radio for a few months before getting married in a warehouse parking lot surrounded by friends and family who flew brightly colored kites to congratulate us as we drove away. 

Dreams are weird and wonderful

and clearly, we’ve been on the road too long. After almost a month of circumnavigating the country to visit family, we returned home last night, eyes blurry with road dust, hearts full of snapshot moments and memories.

This is a favorite snapshot, taken in my folk’s backyard last week. It’s imperfect and in so being, captures something true that I can’t quite put my finger on...

It’s as if this photograph is telling a small, intricate story about my life that I can’t hear because I’m too caught up in the meta-narrative to perceive it. 

In the same way that I can be so fixated on watching the sunset that I fail to notice how the sun’s kind light visits the faces of those who watch with me. The golden twilight gathers generously in the corners of their eyes, dissolves on their smiles like honey in tea. 

Humans are so lovely in their details. I’m learning that. Life is too, I think. 

Every day is a feast of morsels inviting us to lick our plates clean as the full moon that rises after the kind sun sets. 

Remember the kites in the warehouse parking lot? 
It’s the details that make the story, that find the beauty, that celebrate life. 

Look for kites, friends. Fly them so that others can notice and celebrate too. 

🧵Side note—my shorts and his pants are made of the same fabric. We’re one step away from his and her matching jogging suits I think. 😂

My 5th garment made using the #hinterlanddress pattern from @sewliberated .  It’s definitely a workhorse of a pattern for me!  I used the bodice in my usual size, and added about 13cm length from the finished bodice line, and did the teeniest little hem because I forgot to add extra hem allowance 🤨

Next time I’ll add more width around the hips as this one does feel a little snug.  I really was winging it and I should’ve done some measuring.  Oh well, still cute, and kinda “Picnic-Mom” vibes (is that a thing?)

I had planned to sew this dress as maternity wear, but as you can see by the third photo, I’ve left it a bit late!! 🤣 Our beautiful girl is 14 weeks old today 🥰
And of course, for my second make since having a baby (first if you don’t count face masks) I’ve completely thrown myself in the deep end with a new pattern in a new fabric, plus buttonholes (which I don’t have much practice at)! On top of which I’m following the excellent blog post on the @sewliberated website to hack the #hinterlanddress to a v-neck with slightly wider, longer sleeves and elastic gathered back waist. AND THEN I’m thinking of adding a ruffle to the sleeve as well 😅
So, you know, just a quick project that’s entirely appropriate for life with a 3 month old baby! 😂
Fortunately, my muslin of the size 8 bodice with cap sleeves fit pretty much perfectly out of the box (second pic) so at least I don’t have to make any adjustments for the fit #sewingwin 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Pretty shell buttons from @spotlightstores (hard to choose between the two pictured) and conveniently matching linen bias tape from @wearethefabricstore that I had in my stash already.

41,"Last day of #sewyourselfsustainable ! At the beginning of the month the challenge I set myself was to use up some of the fabric I already own and to actually sew up a pattern I haven't used yet. Well well weeheeeell I only managed to sew ONE thing this month and HOW CONVENIENT it is that it is both of those things 😏

Ive had the hinterland dress pattern for about two years now after seeing it and wanting to live out my floaty woodland fairy dreams but quickly realised that dresses just aren't really ma thayng...🧚‍♀️

So when I only had a tiny weeny bit left of my favourite ever black pique knit (that year 8 PE kit polo shirt vibes fabric) I thought I'd finally give the pattern a go. Too soon for a dress though IMO so instead I just didn't do the skirt and left it as a top instead. Haven't worn it yet because it is coooooold but very glad I managed to squeeze every little inch possible out of the fabric before buying anything else! 

Will be sad not to have the outer accountability to post (almost) everyday anymore... But have had a good time following along with the challenge nonetheless! Thanks @newcrafthous @pfaffuk !!🎉

Gratuitous pic no.1 I'm wearing my @lysimaque_sew #lavandelysimaque top which I loooooove

42,"Blessed Mabon and happy first day of autumn! We always celebrate the changing of the seasons but this week is completely crazy (as I try and prepare @otterandspell for Yarndale this weekend) so we aren't doing anything special today. Hopefully this weekend we will find time to sit down to a big meal and light some candles, go for a walk, look for acorns and gather fallen leaves to make into some sort of 'art'. I'm also going to make an apple crumble after I've seen a few on here this week and I've been thoroughly INFLUENCED 😂

Do you do anything to celebrate the changing of the seasons? I'd love to hear!

Been thinking how I don’t care if these dresses I LOVE so much make me look as though I’m pregnant sometimes (swipe to see).
These dresses speak me and feel so good to wear all the time, any day, any time of the year.
And I will keep wearing them because #fuckflattering 
These dresses are my uniform and I can just see that I’m going to wear them for the rest of my life! 🙌

45,"I finally finished my sleeveless #hinterlanddress by @sewliberated !!!
.
I would have completed it weeks ago had it not turned out to be quite so roomy. (I regret not following the advice of other #sewists regarding this pattern, as well as my own experience with the #estuaryskirt and going down a size.) As I didn’t want to rush into making any alterations I sat with it (i.e. procrastinated) for a long time before deciding that the easiest option was adding a back waist elastic channel (as per the #hinterlanddresshack ). This cinches in the waist quite well, greatly improving the overall shape. I also added about 3 inches extra length to the skirt, so it sits around mid-calf, which is perfect. .
.
My only other issue with this pattern is that only four buttons makes for a tight squeeze getting it on and off. Next time I’ll be doing the full button placket. .

I used a lovely textured #linen and gorgeous #corozobuttons from @minervasbower .

Bring on summer! .

46,"Hinterland Dress Back Tie Hack

I’m pretty excited about how this turned out. I used a size 10 bodice with a slight forward shoulder adjustment. My bust measurement puts me between 12 and 14 in this pattern but when I muslined the shoulders were all wrong. Instead of a button placket on the front, I made rouleau ties and drafted plackets for the back. I modeled them off of the front placket pieces and kept the interfacing.  For the hem I didn’t want to lose any length so I made a hem facing and did a blind hem stitch by hand. I love the weight and structure it gives. I really want to make a sleeved version of this dress but it’s clear I’m going to need a broad back adjustment and maybe FBA, so I’ll tackle those another day. 

Fabric is a linen sheet I splurged on a couple years ago. Turns out I don’t love sleeping on linen as much as I like wearing it.

For my second hinterland I got a bit frisky and shortened the skirt, did a slit down the back with a top button closure, and some skinny waist ties.

Bei dem Kleid handelt es sich um ein #hinterlanddresshack. Das Oberteil habe ich komplett auf den Kopf gestellt, weil es nicht passen wollte😔 Ich habe die Knopfleiste weggelassen, die Brustabnäher verlegt und abgeändert, den Halsausschnitt und die Schulterpartie abgeändert... Und die Bindebänder vergessen 🤔

Dette er overdelen til Hinterland Dress forlenget til en topp. Plagget er sydd i deilig gul lin. Knappene har jeg kjøpt hos @sysaker_com. Ønsker meg sånne knapper på alt nå.
Buksa er sydd etter mønster og i kordfløyel fra @stoffstil. Jeg la selv til lommer og beltehemper.

I had imagined a wonderfully silky floaty classic cut almost black short sleeve dress, but it hasn't come out quite how I wanted, it's a bit big, so I'm not sure about it at the mo. // but the fabric is stunning, it's the tencel twill by @merchantandmills which has the best drape, and is a fairly sustainable option (made from wood pulp I believe) and just swishes in the best way (& is £15 a m which I think is totally worth it). // I have been wearing it, but am thinking about adding waist ties like on a hinterland dress, but the lump you get in the back from the bow is a little annoying sometimes so I'm not sure. I think the seam might be too high for a belt too?? // worn with my handmade moon shade necklace, over a RTW striped top, and leggings and Lichen duster by me // #hinterlanddresshack #sewliberated #sewcialists #lichenduster #sewcialists",instagram.com/p/CEwcfOlAYqG,,7,7,122,

Ive got a post up on @minervadotcom  with more pics/info about this dress. I have fabric slated for another Sadie, and I’ve got a construction question for all of you out there. One side of the front facing always flips out despite the understitching. Is there a magic method to alleviate this?? Im wondering if it has something to do with how it’s cut on the bias, or the facing piece that is interfaced vs the body of the dress that isn’t?? I’m all ears my friends! 💓

I really have made friends with the Olya Shirt that nearly broke my emerging shirt making spirit. It’s such a fabulous pattern!
I think there should be a fan group called “I survived making the Olya” ... because once navigated, the engineering of the sleeves is magical! 🌟 
I avoided using interfacing in the collar and cuffs as I’d always got into a bit of a tangle with them. That’s why I’m holding the floppy collar 🤦🏼‍♀️
Now that I’ve seen @grainlinestudio with @jen_beeman Archer Shirt tutorial, all my collars and cuffs will be interfaced with confidence!

Did I mention this was my first time participating in #memademay?? I'm at the one year anniversary of my garment sewing journey. I actually attempted this shirt many many months ago when I was just beginning. It didn't go well... This time was much better. Way more knowledge behind me! Even so, I don't think I could have gotten by with just the written directions. The photo directions in the sew along are very helpful, especially for the pockets. I used some helpful tips from my Cornell shirt collar application-- stay stitching the bodice and cutting into the seam allowance before pinning. I really really like this collar shape! And it's quite different from the many kalle shirts I've made. More petite and understated.
.
I included a photo of three pieces that come together at the armpit seam. I really like how it all works there.
.
This cotton was fairly stable and easy to work with, but it still stretched out in unexpected ways-- that is, not just along the bias. My button plackets ended up too short because my shirt edge had stretched. Same with my cuffs. You can see in one of the later photos that I added a third mini pleat to make up for a 2+ cm difference.
.
I am smack dab between 16 and 18, so sized down. (Or did I go down to 14? Can't remember! I cut out the pattern so so long ago...) As I got close to finishing I was worried it would lack the oversized feel I wanted. However, I'm pretty pleased in the end with the fit. Actually ridiculously pleased.
.
I am still on the fence about top stitching the pockets. We'll see. I do love top stitching! 
.
I think a little mini challenge for myself for the next few days will be playing around with styling this new shirt.
.
What have I learned so far from #memademay? I make way too many shirts and not enough pants... I'll work on that.

Today, I want to give a shout out to the paper theory #olyashirt. I made three last year and I just love how they fit my body shape.

I was so intimidated by the arm construction (and made a big mess of my first attempt), but the way the shape hangs from my broad shoulders is just perfect.

This one is in a cotton linen blend from @fabricgodmother. Quite a thick fabric, and very slightly off-white, which helps to make it feel a little less formal. I made a straight size 10 with an extra 1.5 inches in each sleeve to account for my long arms.

I’ve not tried the shirt dress version yet, but after seeing @heritageninja style hers as a duster earlier this week, I’m seriously tempted.

All the details for these garments are in previous posts, but I should say that this Olya was very much inspired by @the.social.fabric 💛 Nisan has made many a fabulous Olya shirt!

The fabric for this shirt is all linen from various sources.  Scraps from this project became the starting point for a curved quilt project that I began earlier this year, and the same color palette translated to a fabric painting and woven wall-hanging ✨✨✨ curious and gratifying to me how all kinds of creative things connect in hindsight.

47,"okay, #memademay, this is fun ✨ day 4 • i made an #olyashirt turned dress a few months ago but have only worn it once • decided it to throw it on for a day of working from home & went *wild* for daycare drop-off by pairing it with a vintage chore coat • the result is a tad more grunge than what i typically wear but got a thrill out of trying something new •

Today I’m wearing the first #olyashirt from @paper_theory that I made. 

When the fabric arrived the colour wasn’t as expected and I felt it wasn’t a great colour for my peely wally Scottish complexion so it became a wearable toile.  I love the style of this shirt so I’ve made a few since this one. 

I need to give thought to keeping or recycling it as I’ve only worn it a few times. 🤔

I’m pretty proud of this make as I took my time and did little bits each day until voila, we had a shirt. The construction is so interesting it was an exercise in mindfulness! 

I don’t reach for this shirt much as turns out button up shirts don’t really suit me! Trying to make it work though 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Sewing instead of tv watching tonight to get this pink #soifarrahjumpsuit done 💪 Thank goodness it’s not a Handmaid’s Tale release day 😅

50,"Back in the office (at the kitchen table) for #memademay day 4, so I’ve pulled out this trusty combination: an #olyashirt and a pair of #arthurpants.

The shirt is a squishy double gauze, and the pants are a brushed cotton twill, finished with a shiny metal button I found on the floor. 

These are honestly the best shirt and trouser patterns I’ve ever tried for my body shape. Plenty of room for shoulders and hips.

My first make of #memademay2021 was a scrap buster that turned out meh and still needs work. So to cheer myself up, I dug into my stash. I got this ahmazing cobalt linen from @theslewist
👋🏻
I also happened upon the inspo shirt while searching for scrap busting ideas. So I frankensteined some patterns together. I’m going to make some tweaks and make myself a dedicated pattern for this.

55,"⁣First make of #memademay2021.⠀
⠀
This has actually been in the works for ages but finally finished yesterday. This is partly self drafted, with the starting point being the #OlyaShirt by @paper_theory. I had to make some small changes to the body in order to line up sides seams to the bottom half, and I also changed the collar as I wanted an open look for this jumpsuit. I decided on an elasticated waist to keep the gathering even⁣ (and for ~comfort~ reasons), belt loops and D-ring belt in the same fabric. ⠀
⠀
Really pleased with how this turned out, already thinking of making another one in a linen blend for summer 😎⠀
⠀
Fabric is an incredibly floaty and comfortable Japanese cupro from @rainbowfabrickilburn

Scrunchie is by @lazy.lazy.daisy at @studio.slug and I’m obsessed with it. ⠀

57,"It's #mmm2021 day 3 and I am wearing a #olyashirt from @paper_theory . I had previously shown it in the stories, but never took the time to write about it. I have learned sooo much with this pattern - the shoulder seam is unusual and the instructions on how to do the collar are so nicely done. Really, if for nothing else the shirt is worth making in order to learn about collars. It's a go to piece when I don't feel like wearing just a t-shirt but I'm also not feeling like dressing up. I do regret my fabric choice. It's 100% cotton in sage green, which is beautiful, but now that I'm wear it it doesn't feel very me. Maybe I should try this again in a stronger colour..

59,"Playing around with the light on day 2 of #memademay2021 ☀️ and feeling very inspired by all the #sewcreativephotos 
.
I finished this #olyashirt on Friday and actually wore it yesterday too - I'm absolutely in love with the lines and the shape of the shirt, and obsessed with this warm green linen from @merchantandmills (colour is Pine). It catches the sunlight so beautifully! 
.
.
As I was making this shirt I was thinking it was a pattern I'd probably never make again as I struggled quite a bit on the shoulders in particular. However now that I have it on I'm more tempted to make it again 😂 with both shoulders I did find that seemed to have far too much fabric on the sleeve to join it with the yoke, and it kept forming gathers. In the end I had to ignore the notches and take some length off to get it to fit. Not sure what happened there but seems like others have also had this issue? Edited to say that the maker has a very useful sewalong with photos on their website, which definitely helped with understanding how to rotate the fabrics etc during the shoulder construction. 
.
.
Very happy with it now I've had a couple of days to enjoy it since the 4hr long battle with the shoulder join 😬 wondering if I can squeeze one out of some white double gauze that I have..
